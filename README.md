# NOTE:
This is an upstream fork of https://github.com/thesacredmoocow/g14control-r2 which is an upstream fork of https://github.com/CappyT/g14control that has features and bug fixes that are not yet deemed stable for the official release, but that I have tested and are stable enough for my day-to-day use. There will be new EXEs bundled in the [releases](https://github.com/aredden/G14ControlR2/releases) section that will be released between official releases by me. For those that want the bleeding edge updates/testing branches (but testing and working).

## G14ControlR3
## A simple tray app to control Asus Zephyrus G14 Power options

#### Background:
If you are a user like me, you hate using a bunch of different apps to control all the power saving options of your laptop (sometimes even hidden in the registry) and prefer a simple, handy, tray app utility. The focus of this application is just that!
It does combine all the option offered from other utilities into one, single, configurable TrayApp.

#### What does it do?
G14Control (you can even rename it) can control the current ASUS Power plan, Fan curve, Processor Boost Mode, Processor TDP, dGPU Activation and Screen refresh rate to your needs with a simple right click on the Windows taskbar. You can configure all the presets (and add new ones too) from the `config.yml` file.

#### Does it work?
Not yet fully. Upon turning off dGPU, the program updates windows power plan and forces a restart of the dGPU in device manager. Forcing a dGPU restart is only functional with the 2060MQ models currently.

#### What about Linux?
While is possible to port this app to Linux, at the moment is engineered to work only on Windows.
### Installation
Download the latest release zip from GitHub: https://github.com/aredden/G14ControlR3/releases

Extract it to some permanent location such as C:\Users\[username]\G14Control

Edit the config.yml with text editor as needed (see configuring below)

### Configuring
All done in config.yaml within the root folder of the program. The program must be restarted for any changes to the config.yaml to take effect.

#### `default_power_plan` and `alt_power_plan` MUST BE SET IN ORDER FOR POWER PLAN SETTINGS TO WORK (BOOST, dGPU toggling)
by default, the default power plan is "Balanced" and the alt_power plan is "High performance". You need to set these to the names of your **windows** power plans, ie GameTurbo, Battery saver, etc.

`app_name:` can be customized, this is what the hover text displays over the icon and the windows notification title

`start_on_boot` Set this to `true` or `false`. Note this will create a Windows Registry entry to enable starting on login. Must have files extracted to a permanent location as above. Note: This will popup an administrator UAC prompt the first time you login after each boot. Setting back to false will remove registry key.

Alternatively to make it run on boot WITHOUT UAC prompt, you will have to create a windows task, please see [our Autostart instructions](AUTOSTART.md)

`default_starting_plan` set plan name you want on boot or on restart of the program

`default_ac_plan` This plan name will automatically enable when AC adapter plugged in (set both default_ac_plan and default_dc_plan to `null` to disable this feature)

`default_dc_plan` This plan name will automatically enable when on battery power (set both default_ac_plan and default_dc_plan to `null` to disable this feature)

`default_gaming_plan` Enable this if you want the program to auto-switch plans based on games (or any program really) running. It will automatically switch to the plan specified here when the program is launched, and automatically switch back to the previous plan once it has closed. Set to `null` to disable.
- WARNING: this may be more resource intensive as it polls running processes on your computer every 10 seconds. However I noticed little difference, and almost no score change on Heaven Benchmark (FPS +/- 2).

`default_gaming_plan_games` This will be a list of exe's that you want to detect. Please check the exact name of the exe. For example, Steam is SteamService.exe. Example list: ["7zFM.exe", "notepad++.exe", "SteamService.exe"]

##### Notes on using Auto Power Switching:
- Only available if `default_ac_plan` and `default_dc_plan` are set in config (set to `null` to disable)
- Manually changing your plan thru the icon menu will DISABLE auto power switching.
- To re-enable, click the "Re-Enable Auto Power Switching" option in the icon menu.


##### Configure plans
Under Plans, you can configure as many or few plans as you want. A plan includes:
```
- name:
    This is where you will enter the name you want to be displayed for that plan
  plan:
    Name of the ROG Armory plan you want it set on (`silent` or `windows` or `performance` or `turbo`)
  cpu_curve:
    An array of `temps_in_deg_C:fanspeed_percent` for custom fan curve such as "30c:0%,40c:0%,50c:0%,60c:0%,70c:34%,80c:51%,90c:61%,100c:61%". Otherwise use `null` for default
  gpu_curve:
    An array of `temps_in_deg_C:fanspeed_percent` for custom fan curve such as "30c:0%,40c:0%,50c:0%,60c:0%,70c:34%,80c:51%,90c:61%,100c:61%". Otherwise use `null` for default
  cpu_tdp:
    The tdp you want for the CPU expressed in mW, use `null` for default or numeric (45000 = 45W)
  boost:
    Whether you want the CPU to boost above it's 3.0Ghz base clock speed. 0 for no boost, 2 for aggressive boost, 4 for efficient aggressive boost (reccommended)
  dgpu_enabled:
    Whether you want the dedicated NVIDIA GPU enabled (uses more power, need for graphics/games), `true`, `false`
  screen_hz:
    The refresh rate of the screen. Can be 60 (numeric) or 120 (numeric) (for supported models) or null for default refresh rate of your screen
```

The config.yaml has many examples of plans included by default. Modify at will.

### Important Note about ASUS ROG Armory Crate
The ASUS ROG Armory Crate program will automatically change plans on wake, AC unplug, AC plugin. This will override G14's plan setting, but It is important to keep Armory Crate for the power profiles so that it's easier to fix fan bugs from occuring due to atrofac-cli.exe.

### Downloads:
Check the release tab!


### How to build:
Make sure 32-bit python 3.8.x and pip are installed. Then (as admin, in the source folder) run install.bat

The install directory is C:\G14Control, go there and modify the config.yml as needed. ensure that windows has at least two power plans.
the default power plan will be selected 99% of the time, but will flip to the alternate plan for a bit to force a refresh of the power plan settings

run G14control\G14Control.exe

Optionally: create a task in task manager to have it start by itself
